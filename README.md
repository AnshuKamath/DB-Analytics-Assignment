# Database and Analytics Coursework

This repository contains the coursework for the Databases and Analytics module (CP60056E, CP6CS56E, CP6HA50E, CP6SA56E).

## Overview

This assignment focuses on three main areas of database and data analytics:

1. **Data Analysis in R**: Analyzing the GreenFuture's Innovation Management System data using SQL operations in R
2. **Python Data Analysis**: Bookstore Management Information System case study using NumPy and Pandas
3. **MongoDB Analysis**: Implementation and analysis of a NoSQL database system

## Repository Structure

- `/datasets/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis
  - `greenfuture_ideas_dataset.csv`: Dataset for Section 1 (R Analysis)
  - `bookstore_transactions.csv`: Dataset for Section 2 (Python Analysis)
  - Various JSON files for MongoDB collections (Section 3)
- `/notebooks/`: Google Colab notebooks for each section
  - `Section1_R_Analysis.ipynb`: R and SQL analysis of GreenFuture dataset
  - `Section2_Python_Analysis.ipynb`: NumPy and Pandas analysis of Bookstore dataset
  - `Section3_MongoDB_Analysis.ipynb`: MongoDB implementation and analysis

## Section 1: GreenFuture Data Analysis in R

This section explores a dataset from an environmental consulting firm's innovation management system. The analysis includes:
- SQL operations (select, insert, update, delete)
- Data manipulation using mathematical and aggregate functions
- Executing SQL queries in R
- Data visualization using R plotting libraries

## Section 2: Bookstore Management Information System

This section uses Python libraries (NumPy and Pandas) to analyze transaction data from a bookstore management system, including:
- Data import and consolidation
- Statistical analysis
- Visualization of numerical features

## Section 3: MongoDB Implementation

This section demonstrates the design and implementation of a NoSQL database system, including:
- Schema design for various collections
- CRUD operations on MongoDB Atlas
- Data analysis and visualization

## Tools and Technologies

- R programming language
- Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- SQL
- MongoDB
- Data visualization libraries
